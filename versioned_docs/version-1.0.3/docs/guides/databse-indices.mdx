# Database Indices (.indexOn)

One to Many Relations require Indices to be placed in Firebase DB rules.
Instead of writing the indecies yourself, We have created a helper function that returns the JSON string that should be added to the Firebase DB rules

After You initiallize the Frost App call the [getIndices](../../api/classes/Frost#getindices) static function From the [Frost](../../api/classes/Frost) class.

```ts
const firebaseConfig = {
  ...
};

export const FrostApp = Frost.initialize(firebaseConfig,{
...
})

//highlight-start
const indices = Frost.getIndices()
//do anything you want with the string
console.log(indices)
//highlight-end
```
