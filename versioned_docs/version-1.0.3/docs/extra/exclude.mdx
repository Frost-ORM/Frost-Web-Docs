# Excluding Data
Frost provides another Deocrator [`Exclude`](../../api/decorators/Exclude), so you can mark the properties that you don't want to be serialzied and pushed to the server.

```ts

@FrostEntity({collectionPath:"/users"})
class User extends FrostObject<User>{
    id?:string
    name!:string
    userType!: "Customer" | "Admin"

    @Exclude()
    selected?:boolean;

    @Exclude()
    localProperty?:boolean;
    ...

}
```
