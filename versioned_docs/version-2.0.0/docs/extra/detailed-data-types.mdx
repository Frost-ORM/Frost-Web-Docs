# Detailed Data Types
The portion of the schema bellow we'll be used to explain the Data types.
```prisma
model Student {
    @@node(path:"/students")
    name string
    year  SchoolYear
    birthday Date?
    email string?

    courses Course[] @Relation()
    club Club @Relation()

}

enum SchoolYear {
    FRESHMAN = "FRESHMAN"
    SOPHOMORE = "SOPHOMORE"
    JUNIOR = "JUNIOR"
    SENIOR = "SENIOR"
}


model Course {
    ...

    students Student[] @Relation()

    ...

}

model Club {
    ...
    
    members Student[] @Relation()

    ...
}


```
## Generated Types
- All Types and Enums defined in the schema will be generated with the same names.
- A variety of types will be generated for each model, as described below:

### "Basic Model" Type
This Type describes the base node shape without any "properties from connected relation" or node metadata. ***It extends [FrostObject](../../api/types/FrostObject)***
```ts
type Student = FrostObject & {
    name: string;
    year: SchoolYear;
    birthday?: Date;
    email?: string;
};
```
### FrostMetadata Related Types

#### "Model FrostMetadata" Type 
This Type describes the shape of the frost metadata in the node for the specific model.
```ts
// This Model Has no one-to-one relations
type StudentFrostMetadata = {
    __frost__: {
        'one_to_many': {
            club?: OneToManyMetadata | null;
        };
        'many_to_many': {
            courses?: ManyToManyMetadata | null;
        };
    };
};
```
#### "Model With FrostMetadata" Type
This Type is the combination of the Base Model and the Model Metadata types. ***and it actually describes the true shape of the node in the database, since all nodes will have the metadata inside it***
```ts
type StudentWithMetadata = Student & Partial<StudentFrostMetadata>;
```

### Include Related Types

#### "Each Include of The Model" Types
An Include type is generated for each relation in the model, this type represents the property inside the object when a certain relation is included.
The type will be a `Record` in case of many and single instance incase of one.
```ts
type StudentIncludeCourse = {
    courses?: Record<string, CourseWithMetadata>;
};
type StudentIncludeClub = {
    club?: ClubWithMetadata;
};
```

#### "IncludeAll" Types
This Type is the combination of All the generated include types from the previous section.
```ts
type StudentIncludeAll = StudentIncludeCourse & StudentIncludeClub;
```

### "FullModel" Type
This Type is the combination of The ModelWithMetada & IncludeAll. and it describes the returned data when all relations are included
```ts
type StudentFullModel = StudentWithMetadata & StudentIncludeAll;
```

### Properties Keys Related Types
#### Base Properties
This type describes the properties names without relations (ie; the properties of the base model)
```ts
type StudentPropertiesKeys = "name" | "year" | "birthday" | "email" | "courses" | "club";
```

#### Properties With Relations
These types describe the properties names with relations.

```ts
// This Model Has no one-to-one relations
//type StudentOneToOneRelationsFieldsKeys = ...; if the model has one to one

type StudentManyToManyRelationsFieldsKeys = "courses";

type StudentOneToManyRelationsMasterFieldsKeys = "club";
type StudentOneToManyRelationsSalveFieldsKeys = never;
type StudentOneToManyRelationsFieldsKeys = "club";

type StudentRelationsFieldsKeys = StudentManyToManyRelationsFieldsKeys | StudentOneToManyRelationsFieldsKeys;

type StudentRelationsFieldsKeysByType = {
    // one_to_one: ...; if the model has one to one
    many_to_many: StudentManyToManyRelationsFieldsKeys;
    one_to_many: StudentOneToManyRelationsFieldsKeys;
    one_to_many_master_fields: StudentOneToManyRelationsMasterFieldsKeys;
    one_to_many_slave_fields: StudentOneToManyRelationsSalveFieldsKeys;
};
```



## Auto Mapped Types 
<!-- TODO Add more details-->

### [IncludeOptions](../../api/types/includeoptions) Type
This Type determine the shape of the include options map to be passed to fetching and querying functions in [FrostDelegate](../../api/classes/frostdelegate) (findOne,observeOne,findMultiple,observeMultiple,findMany,observeMany)

```ts
type StudentIncludeOptions = IncludeOptions<StudentRelationsFieldsKeys>;
```

### [ConnectOptions](../../api/types/connectoptions)/[DisconnectOptions](../../api/types/disconnectoptions) Type

These Types determine the shape of the connect map to be passed to editing functions in [FrostDelegate](../../api/classes/frostdelegate) (add,update,delete)

```ts
type StudentConnectOptions = ConnectOptions<StudentRelationsFieldsKeysByType>;
type StudentDisconnectOptions = DisconnectOptions<StudentRelationsFieldsKeysByType>;
```

### [FetchReturnType](../../api/types/fetchreturntype)

- This Type is ***Returned*** from all the ***Fetching*** & querying functions in FrostDelegate. Hence the name, [FetchReturnType](../../api/types/fetchreturntype).
- This Type Determines the final shape of returned data depending on the [IncludeOptions](#includeoptions) passed to the fetch function.

:::info
The fetch and query functions don't directly return the [FetchReturnType](../../api/types/fetchreturntype). But they return a type that includes it.
For example: incase of a findMany or findMultiple the return type would be  `Promise< Record<string,FetchReturnType> >`
:::

## Indexed Access Types
For Each model, The main types are grouped in one type. This allows the user to use index access(`[]`) on the grouped type.
```ts
type StudentTypes = {
    FullModel: StudentFullModel;
    Model: Student;
    ModelWithMetadata: StudentWithMetadata;
    IncludeAll: StudentIncludeAll;
    RelationsFieldsKeys: StudentRelationsFieldsKeys;
    RelationsFieldsKeysByType: StudentRelationsFieldsKeysByType;
    PropertiesKeys: StudentPropertiesKeys;
    FrostMetadata: StudentFrostMetadata;
    ConnectOptions: StudentConnectOptions;
    DisconnectOptions: StudentDisconnectOptions;
    IncludeOptions: StudentIncludeOptions;
};

// For example: To access StudentIncludeAll
StudentTypes["IncludeAll"]
```
