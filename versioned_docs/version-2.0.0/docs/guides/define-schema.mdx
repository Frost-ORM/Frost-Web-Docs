description: A guide on how to define nodes and the relations between them using Frost Schema Language
title: Define Frost Schema
---
The schema for The Frost Client is defined using the Frost Schema Language (FSL), 
a detailed guide on FSL can be found [here](/frost-schema-language).

***Please checkout [Types Definitions](/frost-schema-language#defining-types)  and [Enums Definitions](/frost-schema-language#defining-enums) Sections in [FSL guide](/frost-schema-language)***

Before Defining Models create `frost/schema.fsl` file in your project directory, this will contain the schema.

## Define the models

The syntax for defining a model is very similar for defining a Type except for a few differences.
- Start the definition with `model` keyword followed by the model name, As in lines `[1,10]`.
- After the name of the model open two curly brackets which denotes the model block containing all the properties of that model
- define the properties of the model with this pattern `<property_name> <property_type>`
  - checkout the allowed property types in the ["Allowed Data types"](/frost-schema-language#allowed-data-types) section in [FSL quick guide](/frost-schema-language).
  - properties could be optional by adding `?` to the type
  - properties could be arrays by adding `[]` to the type

```prisma
model Student {

  name String
  email String

  dateOfBirth Date 

}

model Course {

  level CourseLevel // a user-defined enum
  name String
  duration Int

}
```
### Node database path
The `node` pragma is used to add any extra metadata for the node model.
The `path` argument in the node pragma is used to determine the path of the node in the firebaseDB 
that will contain the list of the model nodes. if the `node` pragma is not used the path will default to the same name of the model.

As you can see in ***Lines 4 and 19***, the node pragma is used to define the paths for each model
```prisma showLineNumbers
model Student {

  name String
  email String

  // the students list will be stored in te following path in the database /students/<student_id>
  @@node(path:'students') 

  dateOfBirth Date

}

model Course {

  // the courses list will be stored in te following path in the database /courses/<course_id>
  @@node(path:'courses') 

  level CourseLevel // a user-defined enum
  name String
  duration Int

}
```

### Defining the Relations

- Property definition statements in the model can accept the [`Relation` modifier](/frost-schema-language#relation-modifier).
  - Other models can be used as data types in the model properties declaration, and actually you will have to use them if you want to decalre a relation between two models
- To connect two models, simply:
  - Define a property on each model with the type of the other model you want to connect to.
  - Add `@Relation()` after the property definition, as in Lines `[10,26]` in the code block below.
  - The Type of the relation is determined by the Data type (wheter it's an array or not):
    - ***Many To Many***: if both sides are arrays
    - ***One To Many***: if one side is an array and the other is not.
    - ***One To One***: if both sides are not arrays
  - In the example below the relation is `Many-to-Many` due to both sides being array types.

:::info
You can define multiple relations between the same models; by passing the name of the relation to the `name` argument in the relation modifier,
you can find a detailed guide [here](/frost-schema-language#relation-modifier)

```prisma showLineNumbers
model Student {

// the students list will be stored in te following path in the database /students/<student_id>
  @@node(path:'students') 

  name String
  email String 
  dateOfBirth Date 

  courses Courses[] @Relation() 
// this property is used to define a relation with the Course model,
// since the data type is model. you will find a corresponding property in the Course model
// Since properties on both side are array types then the relation is `many to many`

}

model Course {

  // the courses list will be stored in te following path in the database /courses/<course_id>
  @@node(path:'courses') 

  level CourseLevel // a user-defined enum
  name String
  duration Int

  students Student[] @Relation()
}
