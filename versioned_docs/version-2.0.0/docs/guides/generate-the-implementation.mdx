## Location of the schema file
The default name and location for the frost schema file is `$PROJECT_DIR/frost/schema.fsl`,
but if the user wants to store the file in a different name or location,
then you can specify the  path for the file in ***`package.json`***

```json5
{
    ...

    "frost":{
        "schema":{
            "path":"<path_to_schema_file>"
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

## The `generate` command
After defining the schema and ensuring that you have installed `@frost-orm/frost-web-client` package, 
then you can run the following generate command. 
This will generate all the code required to start using Frost client

```bash
npx frost generate
```

:::info
The generate command has two aliases `gen` and `g`
so you can instead use it as follows
```bash
npx frost g
# Or
npx frost gen
```
