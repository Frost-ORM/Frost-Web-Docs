# Define Relations
In This Section We will list the rules for defining a relation between entities, but if you like you can skip to the guide for each realtion type below. But please look at the higlighted parts.
To define a relation between two entities:
- Define a property in both entities with the type of the other entity. 
- Annotate the properties with [Relation](/api/decorators/Relation).
  - [RelationOptions](/api/types/RelationOptions):
    - ***name***: an unique arbitrary string that could describes the relation and the sides.
      - The Two properties on both side should share the same relation name.
      - Different relations should have different names.
      - The name could be somthing like "{side1}-{side2}" so "user-profile" or "student-courses".
      - This allows you to have multiple relations between the same data types. So for example, if a user has two profiles ["secret profile","public profile"] you could have 2 properties with the same data types but with different relation names.
    - ***relation***: should be one of the values in the enum [RelationTypes](/api/enums/RelationTypes).
      - One of the sides should be the main (master) side and the other would secondray (slave).
      - In Symmetric Relations (One to One, Many to Many) the order of the master and slave doesn't matter.
      - But in Asymmetric Relations (One to Many) the master should be the `One` side and the slave should be the `Many` side.
      - ***The relation parameter is what decides which is the master and which is the slave. the relation parameter should only be defined on the master side***
    - ***type***: the data type of the property that is decorated, this is required becuase of some limitations in the Reflection API in Javascript.
      - ***Due to cyclic dependancy the type of the property should a function that returns the desired type. so `()=> PropertyType`***
      - In the type parameter in the RelationOptions ignore the Array brackets in case of `Many`

:::danger
- ***The [relation](/api/types/RelationOptions#relation) parameter is what decides which is the master and which is the slave. the relation parameter should only be defined on the master side***
- ***Due to cyclic dependancy the type of the property should a function that returns the desired type. so `()=> PropertyType`***

```ts
// User
@FrostEntity(...)
class User extends FrostObject{
  ...
  @Relation(
    {
      name: "User-Profile",
      relation: RelationTypes.ONE_TO_ONE,
      type: ()=> Profile,
    }
  )
  profile: () => Profile
  ...
}


// Profile 
@FrostEntity(...)
class Profile extends FrostObject{
  ...
  @Relation(
    {
      name: "User-Profile",
      type: () => User,
    }
  )
  user: ()=> User
  ...
}
```
<div id="One_To_One"></div>

# One To One 
We'll Use an example of User and Contact Info to explain the process of defining a one to one relation.
- [RelationOptions](/api/types/RelationOptions):
  - ***name***: 
    - an unique arbitrary string that could describes the relation and the sides.
    - In this example, We wil use "userContactInfo"
  - ***relation***:
    - the value will be [RelationTypes.ONE_TO_ONE](/api/enums/RelationTypes#ONE_TO_ONE).
    - you can assign it on either side.
    - In this example, We will assign it on the User side.
  - ***type***: 
    - Due to cyclic dependancy and some limitations in the Reflection API in Javascript.
     you will have to pass the type as a function that returns the type of the property in the decorator
    - In this example, it will be `()=>ContactInfo` on the User side and `()=>User` on the ContactInfo side.

```ts title="example/src/data/user.ts" showLineNumbers
import {ContactInfo} from './contact-info'

@FrostEntity({collectionPath:'/users'})
export class User extends FrostObject{
  id!:string;
  name!:string;
  userType!: "Buyer"|"Seller";

//highlight-start
  @Relation(
    {
      name: "userContactInfo",
      relation: RelationTypes.ONE_TO_ONE,
      type: ()=> ContactInfo,
    }
  )
  contactInfo?: () => ContactInfo;
//highlight-end

}
```

```ts title="example/src/data/contact-info.ts" showLineNumbers
import {User} from './user'

@FrostEntity({collectionPath:'/contact_info'})
class ContactInfo extends FrostObject{
  id!:string;
  email?:string;
  address?:string;
  location?:{lat:string,lng:string};
  postalCode?:string;

  phones?:{
    work:string,
    home:string
  };

  landlines?:{
    work:string,
    home:string
  };

//highlight-start
  @Relation(
    {
      name: "userContactInfo",
      type: () => User,
    }
  )
  user?: ()=> User
//highlight-end

}
```


# One To Many

# Many To Many
Many to Many is very similar to [One To One](#One_To_One) buth the properties type return arrays of the entity type.
We'll Use an example of Student and Courses to explain the process of defining a Many to Many relation (one student could enroll in multiple courses and one course could have multiple students auditing it).
- [RelationOptions](/api/types/RelationOptions):
  - ***name***: 
    - an unique arbitrary string that could describes the relation and the sides.
    - In this example, We wil use "students_courses"
  - ***relation***:
    - the value will be [RelationTypes.MANY_TO_MANY](/api/enums/RelationTypes#MANY_TO_MANY).
    - you can assign it on either side.
    - In this example, We will assign it on the Student side.
  - ***type***: 
    - Due to cyclic dependancy and some limitations in the Reflection API in Javascript.
     you will have to pass the type as a function that returns the type of the property in the decorator
    - In this example, it will be `()=>Course` on the Student side and `()=>Student` on the Course side.
    - ***The property types however should be `()=>Course[]` and `()=>Student[]` respectively***

```ts title="example/src/data/user.ts" showLineNumbers
import {Course} from './course'

@FrostEntity({collectionPath:'/students'})
export class Student extends FrostObject{

  id!:string;
  name!:string;
  year: "FRESHMAN" | "SOPHMORE" | "JUNIOR" | "SENIOR"

//highlight-start
  @Relation(
    {
      name: "students_courses",
      relation: RelationTypes.MANY_TO_MANY,
      type: ()=> Course,
    }
  )
  courses?: () => Course[];
//highlight-end

}
```

```ts title="example/src/data/course.ts" showLineNumbers
import {Student} from './Student'

@FrostEntity({collectionPath:'/courses'})
class Course extends FrostObject{

  id!:string;
  name!:string;
  difficultyLevel!:number;
  duration!: number; // in weeks

//one to many example (slave side)
  @Relation(
    {
      name: "professor_courses",
      type: () => Professor,
    }
  )
  professor?:() => Professor

//highlight-start
  @Relation(
    {
      name: "students_courses",
      type: () => Student,
    }
  )
  students?: ()=> Student[]
//highlight-end

}
```
